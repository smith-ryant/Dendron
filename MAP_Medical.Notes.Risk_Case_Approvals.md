To Do:
Create a document for a Design Change.

Good afternoon,

I hope you're having a great day!

I've reviewed the following Risk Cases in the IMSX software:

Risk Case: 01 – Name: Bacteria or Contagions Can Be Introduced
I have reviewed this, and I approve.

Risk Case: 02 – Name: Lacerations from Osteotome Blades
I have reviewed this, and I approve.

Risk Case: 03 – Name: Cortical Perforation
This has been reviewed. However, this is a bit beyond my expertise.

Mark,

Could you please check this verbiage? If you're okay with it, I'm good with the rest. If you have any changes in mind, please let me know how you'd like it to read, and I'll make the necessary corrections. I have a copy of the case attached to this email so you don’t have to stop and look it up.

Also, regarding this Risk Case, I'll create a document reflecting a request for a design change, specifically adding depth markings to the blades.

Risk Case: 04 – Name: Smashed or Pinched Finger
I have reviewed this, and I approve.

Risk Case: 05 – Name: Possible Contamination From Package Failure
I have reviewed this, and I approve.

Thank you all for your hard work and collaboration!

Best regards,

Ryan
