How I determine stops on Regular Five Star Trades (Five Star with a Twist is more aggressive, and we will use a different formula)

A REGULAR Five Star trade is:
(The best trading plan for a conservative trader, is to stick with conservative pullbacks – to the 34 ema and 50 SMA on the DAILY charts, stick with strongest stocks in strongest sectors, and sell credit spreads. Add long calls in, as you get better, but this is the most conservative trading plan)
A daily and/or 195-minute squeeze on a Five Star Chart that has pulled back to ‘the mean.’ Where is the mean? Can be 8 or 21 EMA (for an aggressive entry) or the 34 EMA or 50 SMA for a conservative entry. This is a classic swing trade that I generally hold for 7-15 days. I trade this with long calls and/or put credit spreads, depending on the market condition. I sell ATM put credit spreads 15-21 DTE looking for a 1:1 risk/reward situation on the trade. And/or I will buy delta .70 calls with 30 DTE IF it’s the best of the best in a relatively bullish or very bullish market condition. In a relatively bullish market condition, just sticking with PCS is the most conservative.
\*When you are using your DAILY and/or 195-minute charts as your SETUP chart, that means this chart is your ANCHOR chart. You are making decisions based on your ANCHOR chart. So, if a 30-minute squeeze fires to the downside, and your setup was the daily squeeze, I do not exit. Why? This is generally just a pullback on the daily chart. You have to look at your points of validity on the daily chart. Is your support broken? Did the DAILY squeeze fire short? If not, I hold.

A Five Star with a Twist is:
(This is for aggressive, directional traders. NOT the best for consistency, but if you want to make aggressive, directional trades in a trending market, this is how I do it)
A Five Star Chart that is extended (trading above the 8 EMA on the daily chart) BUT the market is rocketing higher, and it has a lower time frame setup (such as a 30 or 78-minute squeeze) or high short interest, that makes you believe this ticker will break out to new all-time highs again. This is typically an overnight trade, or a two-day trade. I trade this with delta .70 calls, about 15 DTE. As an AGGRESSIVE trade, I also use about a half size position.

On FIVE - if using the conservative, stop loss levels, your symmetrical points of validity are broken. We still have a 78-minute squeeze, so you could hold out to see if that will fire long. The market is pulling back but not selling off completely, so you could also wait to see what happens there. That is where I'm leaning. It also helps to look at positions on an EOD basis, especially because mid-day doldrums happen almost every day.
Know Your Points of Validity – ‘The trade is valid, IF this support holds, and IF this squeeze fires in the direction we are looking for. IF the support does not hold (must know where that is) the trade idea is therefore rendered invalid and there is no reason to hold the trade.

1. This is always dependent on where the level of support is for your entry. Is your support at the 34 EMA? Is your support at the 50 SMA? Different charts have different personalities. With AMZN, your support might be at the 8 EMA. Therefore, you would not use the 50 SMA as your stop.
2. Your stop should be below your level of support that you used.
3. Where should you look at support?? I always use the DAILY charts as my anchor. That means, look at the moving averages + symmetry on the daily chart. This is key. However, if you’re a more active trader, and you want to manage your positions intra-day, go down to the 30, or 78-minute charts, and draw symmetry there. Benefit of using a lower time frame for symmetry? Well, you can hone your entries and exits better. In the beginning, using the daily chart is just fine. BUT, I like to get a more precise level, on the lower time frame.
4. Do NOT worry/panic if your trade comes back to support AFTER it triggers, but BEFORE it makes the target. This is why it’s called support. Price comes back here and sits, then goes higher.
5. If you have your stop ABOVE support, you WILL get stopped out on good trades. You have to give yourself the opportunity to see your trade through.
6. Another caveat – IF your squeeze fires to the downside, this is not what you want. I exit in this instance.
7. If your squeeze fires to the downside (when you wanted it to fire to the upside) AND your support is broken, this is a definite exit sign.
   Identifying Pullback Zones for New Entries
   When the market has been strong, the question is not IF the market will pull back – because it will. The question is, WHEN and HOW MUCH will it pullback? Use symmetry and moving averages on daily charts to determine pullback zones. You can also use smaller time frame charts to determine pullback zones on an intraday basis and manage your trades more closely.

Start with:
S&P Futures
NQ Futures
You can do daily (for main anchor time frame) and 78-minute charts (to narrow down intraday pullbacks)
Then, look at your Five Star Charts to identify pullbacks. Focus on charts with squeezes.
\*AFTER a big up move in the market (like we have seen the last 2 weeks) there most likely will NOT be squeezes. Why not? Because, a squeeze appears when the market consolidates. This is from the ‘boring’ market condition.
So, what can you do, in absence of squeezes with a pullback?

1. I wait until the pullback stops. What does that mean? You determine points of validity on the indexes and favorite Five Star charts. WHEN the market holds one of your pullback zones, and starts to trigger higher, THEN you know the pullback is ‘over.’ At this point, you can:
   a. Sell credit spreads at your points of validity
   b. IF you have a Squeeze as well (you probably won’t, right after a pullback), then you can look for a more aggressive trade with a squeeze plus calls.
   Remember – the Five Star is the best of the best. You can ALSO trade the Four Stars. The Five Stars don’t come around all the time. When they do, they usually cluster together. For example, Five Star setups on AMZN, AAPL, GOOGL – all at the same time. This is because the index and top weighted products move together. You can usually find honey badger Five Stars (such as WWE, AYX) in the absence of a market move higher via high short interest or the IBD 50 list.
   The time to ‘load the boat’ is generally the cluster of Five Stars and/or the Run into Earnings. A month prior to every earnings season is one of my favorite Five Star ‘load the boat’ times. Why? The Five Star charts are the ones that trade higher going into their earnings reports.
