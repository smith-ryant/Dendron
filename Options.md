## Option are a Leverage Tool

The cost of options is much lower than the cost of the underlying security.

Options are highly leveraged products. Leverage, in terms of investing, means using small about of capital to control larger amounts of capital to lock in larger gains.

You can benefit form moves in the underlying security with far less capital than you'd need to by the underlying equity on it's own.

Additionaly, Options are versatile and flexible

## What is an Option?

Technically, an option is:
"A contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a specified strike price by a specified date."

What does that mean and how do we use it?
We are controlling options contracts for a short period of time to capitalize on the leveraged product. We have to choose varying options strategies, and expriration dates that fit into our technical analysis mold.

This starts with understanding how options work.

### Option Move in Relation to the Underlying Asset

For this reason, our analysis always starts with analysis of the underlying equity.

For example, if we intend to trade Microsoft (MSFT), we start by focusing on the technical chart patter, the fundamentals, and options possibilities.

Then, we move onto our options strategy

Options are Bough or Sold
Buyers (long): Options buyers pay a debit to control the long option until expiration. They are buyying the right to purchase to a stock at a certain price in a way that limits their risk. The goal is to utilize leverage to profit on a move in the underlying.

Sellers (short):
Options sellers sell options to collect premium. They take on the obligation to sell the underlying equity to a buyer if the buyer decides to exercise their option.

The goal is to sell options that will lose value, so they can profit.

### Bullish v. Bearish

Bullish:
Long Calls Trader is a buyer of the options, you want the underlying equity to increase in price.
Long Puts Trader is a buyer of the option, wants the underlying equity to decrease in price.
Bearish:
Short Puts Trader is a seller of the option and wants the underlying equity to increase in price.
Short Calls Trader is a seller of the option and wants to underlying equity to decrease in price.

# What is a setup?

A technical setup is a reason to get into a trade. It is a high probability moment in time, where we know we have an edge.

If we don't have an edge, there is no setup!!

This is the Concept: In a directional trade, we have a high probability moment in time. This is the reason we want to be long (or Short).

The Action: We take advantage ot these high probability moments in time, by utilizing a low risk, high reward strategy.

## What is the Squeeze?

The Squeeze is our primary trading tool. Understanding how to recognize, readd, and trade the Squeeze, is vital to everything. You need to understand how to recognize one, and what thatf means for the underlying.
