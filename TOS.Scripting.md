What is a strategy?

A **trading strategy** is a systematic plan designed to achieve profitable returns in financial markets by making informed decisions on buying and selling assets. It involves a set of rules or criteria that guide traders in determining when to enter (buy) or exit (sell) a trade, based on specific market conditions, indicators, or patterns.

### Key Components of a Trading Strategy:

1. **Asset Selection**: The specific financial instruments to trade (e.g., stocks, options, currencies, cryptocurrencies).
2. **Entry Criteria**: The conditions under which the trader will open a position, such as technical indicators, fundamental analysis, or price patterns.
3. **Exit Criteria**: The conditions under which the trader will close a position, including profit targets, stop-loss levels, or trailing stops.
4. **Risk Management**: Rules to manage risk, such as position sizing, stop-loss orders, and diversification to minimize potential losses.
5. **Timeframe**: The duration of trades, which can range from short-term (day trading) to long-term (position trading or investing).

A successful trading strategy is typically tested, refined, and consistently applied to maximize profit potential while managing risk.
