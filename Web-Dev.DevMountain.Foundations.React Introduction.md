## React Intro

An introduction to React.

To download the demo code for this lecture, run:

```bash
dmget wb-react-intro --demo
```

Then, `cd` into the project directory and use npm to install and run the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Did you know?**

You can use `npm i` as a shortcut to run `npm install`.

## About React

### What is React?

- React is a JavaScript library for web and native user interfaces, originally created and maintained by Facebook.
- React is used to manage the DOM and create highly performant user interfaces and front-end applications.

### Why Use React?

- React helps make UI code easier to maintain by providing structure.
- Utilizes components that encapsulate HTML, logic, and event handlers all together.
- DOM updates automatically whenever the data changes—no need to use `document.querySelector` or similar methods.
- React isn’t just used for building web apps. Learn React once and you can use the same skills to build desktop and mobile apps too.

### How to Create a New React Project

You can use Vite to set up a new React project:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

## Components

### What are Components?

- Components are the building blocks of a React application.
- Components are reusable and contain both UI and logic, together.
- A component is a function that will return a React element that will describe how a section of the user interface will be displayed and interacted with.

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <ul>
      <li>Hello World!</li>
    </ul>
  );
}
```

At minimum, your React component (the App function) needs to return the UI elements that you want it to display on the screen when it is rendered.

**Style conventions for naming components**

- In order to distinguish normal functions from React components, it’s a common practice to use CapitalizedCamelCase as component names instead of lowerCamelCase.

- We use `ReactDOM.createRoot().render()` to render the root component on the page, inside the HTML element with `id="root"`.

This code lives inside the `src/main.jsx` file, which is automatically generated by Vite.

**wb-react-intro-demo/src/main.jsx**

```javascript
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

## JSX

JSX is syntax that allows us to use HTML-like syntax to create React elements.

- It also allows you to template in JavaScript expressions with curly braces (`{}`).

```javascript
if (score > 100) {
  return <b>You win, {playerName}</b>;
}
```

`{playerName}` will template in the value stored in the variable `playerName`.

### Using JSX

You can put any JavaScript expression inside curly braces, such as function calls:

```javascript
return <h1>To Do List for {formatDate(today)}</h1>;
```

Or objects (note the double curlies):

```javascript
return (
  <ul style={{ backgroundColor: "black", color: "pink" }}>
    <li>Read API docs</li>
    <li>Build React component</li>
  </ul>
);
```

### Return Statements

React components must always return the UI elements that you want displayed on the screen.

However, return statements must contain a single root element. So this is not allowed:

```javascript
return (
  <h1>Heading</h1>
  <img src="http://website.com/image.jpg">
);
```

If you don’t want to wrap your elements in a `<div>`, you can use an empty tag called a Fragment:

```javascript
return (
  <>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <img src="http://website.com/image.jpg">
  </>
);
```

**Rendering Arrays**

As of React 16, you can return an array of elements. But it’s still best practice to have one root element, such as a `<div>` or Fragment.

## Props

### Props (a.k.a. properties)

A useful component is a reusable one. Right now, this component isn’t very reusable:

```javascript
function RedButton() {
  return <button>You could click me but nothing would happen</button>;
}
```

It would be better if we could configure our button so we could make each red button have a different message if needed.

```javascript
<RedButton message="Click me" />
```

We want to pass a message to the component so it can display that message. We do this by making a property.

**wb-react-intro-demo/src/RedButton.jsx**

```javascript
export default function RedButton(props) {
  return (
    <button className="redButton" type="button">
      {props.message}
    </button>
  );
}
```

`props` is an object that is passed into the component, so individual props can be accessed with `props.nameOfProp`.

One of the advantages of using React is that you can make components and then reuse them.

Here, we are creating two `RedButton` components with different messages inside our root component, `App`.

```javascript
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <RedButton message="I'm a button" />
      <RedButton message="I'm another button" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Event Handling

### Handling Events in React

- Event handlers are added directly to the React element. Event names look like browser events, but we prefix them with `on` and use camelCase.

```javascript
function AlertButton() {
  function alertMessage() {
    alert("You just handled an event!");
  }

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={alertMessage}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
```

Because they are part of components, event handlers also can access the component’s props:

```javascript
function AlertButton(props) {
  return <button onClick={() => alert(props.message)}>Click me</button>;
}
```

## State

### Props vs. State

- **Props** are information given to your component and cannot be changed (they are immutable).

- React has another core concept called **state** which is used for values that do change.

### How State Works

- State contains data that is used to control how a component should look and behave.

- When state changes, React figures out the difference between before and after by rendering (calling) your component again and comparing what the component returns now vs. before.

- If it sees a difference, React handles updating the DOM for you—no need to do it by hand!

### The useState Hook

- React provides special built-in functions called hooks that each serve a specific purpose.

- We will use one of these hooks, `useState`, to control values that cause the component to re-render when they are changed.

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

- Takes in one argument, the initial state, which can be anything we would like (a string, array, object, number, etc).

- Returns an array containing two things: the first is the state value, and the second is a function we must call to update the state.

- We can store those two things in variables using destructuring.

### Updating State

- To update the state, we must use the function that `useState` returns.

- For example, to increment the value of `count` in the above example, we must call the `setCount` function: `setCount(count + 1)`.

- **Never** update state directly with `count = count + 1`! If you do, React will not detect that the state has changed and will not re-render the component.

### Example: A ClickCounter Component

We can now build a page that displays the number of times a button is clicked.

- If we want to make the initial count customizable, we should make that a prop that can be passed to the component.

- The current count needs to be part of the state since whenever it changes, we want React to re-render the component and display the current value.

**wb-react-intro-demo/src/ClickCounter.jsx**

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";

export default function ClickCounter(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(props.initialCount);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button type="button" onClick={incrementCount}>
        Click me to increase the count
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
