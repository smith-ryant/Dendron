## React Router

### Summary

1. Students can implement BrowserRouter
2. Students can implement the Routes tag
3. Students can use a Link tag to route
4. Students can use useNavigate to route
5. Students can use useParams to pull params off of URL path

In React, we don’t use more than a single HTML file for our application. As such, we need to learn how to navigate to new “pages” in our application. This is called Routing. You will learn how to create all the possible routes you want to account for, create `<Link>` tags rather than `<a>` tags, how to navigate in JS functions using `useNavigate`, and how to pull information off of the URL path using `useParams`.

### Content

In this step, we will set up our basic app navigation via `react-router-dom`, as well as begin styling.

#### Concepts

1. Routing
2. CSS
3. UI/UX
4. REST API

## UI & UX

### Summary

1. Students can identify common design patterns of forms, buttons, dropdowns, radio buttons, and accordions

Being a full stack developer means being able to do it all, and that includes making good design decisions. While most teams have someone dedicated entirely to UI/UX, it is important that you know the basics. Today, you will learn how to size elements appropriately, how to pick correct fonts, and more.

### Content

1. UI UX Design Patterns
2. Project Part 2: Search for and Display Recipes

#### Goal

We are going to add a lot of styling to our site, add a search functionality that allows us to filter through our recipes, as well as display them on screen.

#### Concepts

1. JavaScript methods
2. CSS

#### Steps

1. Style the Ad Banner
2. Create a RecipeCard Component
3. Style the RecipeCard
4. Add Search Input
5. Filter and Map through Recipes

## CSS

### Summary

1. Students can manipulate their HTML elements on the screen via CSS
2. Students can use flexbox

Knowing what to make your page look like is useless without the know-how of how to do it. Today, you’ll cover a lot of CSS properties that you can use to manipulate the elements on the screen. Take careful note of the flexbox videos, as they will be your best friend.

### Content

1. CSS - The Complete Guide
2. Project Part 3: Style the Details page

#### Goal

The recipe cards are cool and all, but we need to see some details! We will add some style to the details page, as well as add routing functionality to get the details on the page!

#### Steps

1. Add routing to the RecipeCard button
2. Code out a Static Detail Screen
3. Grab the ID from the URL
4. Make an Axios Call with the ID
5. Replace the Static Information

## Forms

### Summary

1. Students can get values from input fields
2. Students can handle changes with onChange

Handling information from forms and inputs is something you have already done, but it can get tedious with large forms. You’ll learn about an external library called Formik and how it can help you manage larger forms with ease.

### Content

1. Working with Forms & User Input
2. Project Part 4: Create the new Recipe Form

#### Goal

We will create a form that allows us to create a new recipe.

#### Steps

1. Create the Form
2. Create your initialValues and onSubmit
3. Use Formik to handle the Form
4. Tie the Inputs to Formik
5. Handle the Ingredients
6. Add your ingredients to the existing values
7. Check the Values

### Project Part 5: Style the Form

#### Goal

We are nearly there! Let’s send the values to the API and finish our styling.
