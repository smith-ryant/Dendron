To create a clone of your GitHub repository and work on the `ryan/create-switch-component` branch, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, open your terminal and use the `git clone` command to clone your repository. Replace `<your-git-url>` with the provided URL.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Codemosphere/component-library.git
```

This command will create a local copy of the repository in a folder named `component-library` (the repository's name).

### 2. Navigate to the Repository Directory

Once the cloning process is complete, navigate to the newly created directory:

```bash
cd component-library
```

### 3. Check Out the Specific Branch

After navigating into the repository, check out the branch you want to work on (`ryan/create-switch-component`):

```bash
git checkout ryan/create-switch-component
```

This command switches your current working branch to `ryan/create-switch-component`.

### 4. Verify That You Are on the Correct Branch

You can verify that you are on the correct branch by running:

```bash
git branch
```

This command will list all branches, highlighting the currently active one with an asterisk (`*`). You should see something like:

```plaintext
  main
* ryan/create-switch-component
```

### 5. Start Working

Now you can start working on this branch. Make your changes, commit them, and push them back to the repository as needed:

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Describe your changes"

# Push changes to the remote branch
git push origin ryan/create-switch-component
```

### Next Steps

**a.** Set up a remote tracking branch for easier push and pull operations.  
**b.** Configure your environment or dependencies as specified in the project to start developing.
