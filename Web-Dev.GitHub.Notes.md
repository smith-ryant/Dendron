## Summary of Commands

See more specifics in other sections below

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd path/to/your/project

# Create a new README file
echo "# Name-of-Project" >> README.md

# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add the README file to the staging area
git add README.md

# Commit the file
git commit -m "first commit"

# Create the main branch
git branch -M main

# Add the remote repository URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/smith-ryant/Name-of-Project.git

# Push the changes to the remote repository
git push -u origin main

# Create and switch to a new branch (e.g., feature-branch)
git checkout -b feature-branch

# Make some changes, then add and commit those changes
echo "Some changes" >> changes.txt
git add changes.txt
git commit -m "Added changes to feature-branch"

# Push the new branch to the remote repository
git push -u origin feature-branch

# Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the feature branch into the main branch
git merge feature-branch

# Push the updated main branch to the remote repository
git push origin main
```

## To create a new reposoitory from the command line:

Navigate to the project directory (the root).
Change `Name-of-Project` to the name of your project.

```bash
echo "# `Name-of-Project`" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/smith-ryant/`Name-of-Project`.git
git push -u origin main
```

## To push to an existing repositroy from the command line

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/smith-ryant/`Name-of-Project`.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## To branch off main

To branch from the main of the specified repository and create a new branch named `NameOfComponent.component`, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the repository if you haven't already:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Codemosphere/ViteSantasCauseWebsite.git
```

3. Change into the repository directory:

```bash
cd ViteSantasCauseWebsite
```

4. Ensure you're on the `main` branch and pull the latest changes:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

5. Create and switch to the new branch `NameOfComponent.component`:

```bash
git checkout -b NameOfComponent.component
```

Now you have successfully created a new branch from the `main` branch. You can start working on your changes in the `NameOfComponent.component` branch.

## Push Changes and Merge Them Into the main branch

To push your changes and merge them into the main branch while keeping the branch, follow these steps:

Push the changes to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin section-two
```

Switch to the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main

Merge the section-two branch into the main branch:
```

```bash
git merge section-two
```

Push the updated main branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

## This will push your changes from the section-two branch to the remote repository, merge those changes into the main branch, and then push the updated main branch back to the remote repository.

`What is a git pull?`  
A `git pull` command in Git is used to update the local version of a repository from a remote repository. It is a combination of two commands: `git fetch` and `git merge`. When you execute `git pull`, it first fetches the changes from the specified remote repository (usually the one you cloned from or the origin) and then merges those changes into your current branch.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed breakdown of what happens during a `git pull`:

1. **Fetch**: The command retrieves any updates from the remote repository. This means it downloads new commits, files, and other data from the remote repository.

2. **Merge**: After fetching the updates, `git pull` will merge the updates into your current working branch. If there are any changes that conflict with your local changes, you'll need to resolve those conflicts manually.

The syntax for `git pull` is:

```
git pull [options] [<repository> [<refspec>...]]
```

In most cases, you will use it simply as:

```
git pull
```

This pulls changes from the remote repository and branch that your local branch is tracking.

### Example

To pull the latest changes from the remote repository named `origin` into your current branch:

```
git pull origin
```

If you want to pull changes from a specific branch, you can specify it:

```
git pull origin main
```

This command fetches changes from the `main` branch of the remote repository `origin` and merges them into your current branch.

### Potential Issues

- **Conflicts**: If there are conflicting changes between your local branch and the remote branch, Git will prompt you to resolve those conflicts.
- **Rebasing**: Some teams prefer using `git pull --rebase` instead of `git pull` to maintain a cleaner commit history. This command fetches the changes and then replays your local commits on top of the fetched commits.

To use `git pull --rebase`:

```
git pull --rebase
```

This command can be especially useful to avoid unnecessary merge commits in your project's history.
