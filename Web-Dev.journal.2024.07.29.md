**0900** - Completed the assesssment portion of an application with DataAnnotation. Now, I just sit back and wait to see if it is real or not. According to App, I wait for an email. (Fingers Crossed)

**1200** - DevMountain

**1300** - Penny called with more questions about the drawings for the MAP product. (Weights on the blade drawings) There are 7 blade drawings only 3 of which have weights. Questions about whether or not I could change/add the weights on the drawings for Tana.

The drawings cannot be changed by me, for the 40th time. The drawings originated from SFW and SFW is the one that can change that drawing. I pdf annotated the blades for Tana and all of her bullshit. Fucking Gash!! I am not doing that again.
